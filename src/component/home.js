                    Here we are often brought to grief, whether we know it or not.
                    Grief can seem like an unbearable experience. But for those of 
                    us who have entered the broken world of loss and sorrow, we realize 
                    that in the fractured landscape of grief we can find the pieces of our 
                    life that we ourselves have forgotten.</p>
